# race-prediction-using-neural-networks-AI
using the keras library to implement a neural network that predicts the race of a person's picture

There is a dataset that contains over 23000 images of different people in 5 races.

I have used keras library to create the neural network and changed the hyper parameters to get the best result with the best accuracy
